## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a vulnerability, or even if you are unsure, please report it immediately by sending an email to: joelperez91@gmail.com. Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps and example code to reproduce the issue.

I will thoroughly review your report and respond promptly.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. ðŸ™Š

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
